# MiscTools
This is just a collection of small tools I've made over time for various purposes. None of them really deserve their own repository so I've just made this one for all of them. They're usually just for a one-off or extremely specific purpose, sometimes made completely redundant (e.g. there's a QuickBMS script or better program), but I still think it's a good idea to share the code, if only for archival purposes.
